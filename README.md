# Python Algorithms in Action

This repository contains **pure Python implementations** focused on algorithms, logic, and problem-solving using clear, readable code.

Currently, the repository includes a complete **command-line implementation of Klondike Solitaire**, built entirely with core Python.

---

## Solitaire (Klondike)

`solitaire.py` is a terminal-based version of Klondike Solitaire that demonstrates how game rules and state can be modeled cleanly in Python.

It showcases:
- Object-oriented design
- Rule-based decision logic
- State transitions and validation
- Command-line user interaction

No external libraries are used.

## How to Run

```bash
python solitaire.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

---

## Commands

- `mw` — move card from Stock to Waste  
- `wf` — move card from Waste to Foundation  
- `wt #` — move card from Waste to a Tableau column  
- `tf #` — move card from Tableau to Foundation  
- `tt #1 #2` — move cards between Tableau columns  
- `h` — help  
- `q` — quit  

*(Hearts/Diamonds are red, Spades/Clubs are black.)*

## Purpose

This repository is a learning-focused space to:

- Practice writing clean Python code  
- Build logic-heavy programs from scratch  
- Develop strong algorithmic thinking  

More algorithms and logic-based programs will be added over time.
