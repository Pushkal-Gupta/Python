# Python Algorithms

This repository contains a growing collection of **classic algorithms implemented using 100% pure Python**, along with simple examples that demonstrate how each algorithm works and how it can be used.

The goal is clarity, correctness, and learning — not performance tricks or external libraries.

## What This Repository Covers

- Fundamental algorithms written in plain Python  
- Clear, readable implementations  
- Simple usage examples for each algorithm  
- Code meant for learning, revision, and reference  

---

## Algorithm Categories

Examples of what you’ll find here:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Basic recursion problems
- Mathematical and number-based algorithms
- Game logic and problem-solving scripts

---


## Purpose

This repository is intended to:
- Strengthen core Python problem-solving skills  
- Serve as a quick reference for algorithm implementations  
- Act as a learning log during the Python journey  

---

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning or AI  
- Framework-based implementations  
- Optimized or low-level performance hacks  

This repo values **readability over cleverness**.
